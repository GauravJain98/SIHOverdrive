" Humans normally maintain a body temperature at 37°C, and maintenance of this relatively high temperature is critical to human survival.  Our bodies are designed to tightly control our internal temperature, no matter what the external temperature is.

Operating temperature in a CT/MRI/PET exam room  is normally between 18deg C to 26 Deg C and kept on an average ~22Deg C. Since room temperature is lower than your body temperature, contact surface of medical device (mattress, pad, support surfaces etc..) quickly absorb the heat from patient’s skin, making patient feel cold. This discomfort to patient during medical imaging /Interventional procedures increases the negative patient outcome due to patient shivering & unintended patient motion. Due to this cold temperature, patients may activate “brown” fat at contact surface which contains adrenergic receptors and generates heat by metabolizing glucose. This can show up on scans and potentially hide true “lesions” in PET imaging.

Currently hospitals uses blankets to cover or to enfold a great portion of the Patient's body during scan to trap radiant bodily heat and keeping the body warm. Hospitals uses a lot of blankets as each patient requires a new / washed blanket.. busy centers will go through on avg. 10 blankets in a day. 
Key Constraints: 
User adjustable temperature 
Automated temperature control to set temperature “ Range 20°C -40°C”. Quick response to set temperature within 3 min.

" NALCO Smelter Plant has 04 Pot lines with 08 Pot Rooms and each Pot Room having 120 Pots. There are 2 Cast Houses and 1 Rolling Plant as well. Hot metal is tapped through Tapping Ladles from 960 pots and then transferred into transport ladles on the metal transporting trucks (MTT) for delivery to the desired Cast House Location as per the requisition made by the individual Cast Houses and Rolling Plant. 

 N.B:        	
•	Maximum 16 nos. of trucks can be deployed in the Pot Rooms.
•	The liquid metal is tapped at around 960°C.
•	The Cast House desired temperature range for metal casting 720°C-760°C.
•	If the metal arrives at little above the casting temperature value then it is ready for casting and no fuel is required to be burnt in the metal holding casting furnaces.

 
Operation:

A.	Cast House–A (Operation) prepares Metal Planning Schedule for 04 shifts on daily basis and forwards Hard/Soft Copy to Pot Line (Operation).

B.	After receipt of the metal planning schedule the Pot Line (Operation) shift-in-charge prepares tapping schedule for his shift.
  
C.	From the tapping schedule ladle schedule is derived along with the metal dispatch against requirement by Cast House (Operation).

D.	Accordingly MTT deployment by the Pot Line (Operation) transport section is arranged for each Pot Line Room Location to the respective Cast House in a Merry-go-Round fashion during the shift hours. 

E.	Normally Cast House-B and Rolling Plant forward their shift wise ladle requirement, in terms of no. of ladles required by them in a shift, initially to the Transport Section of Pot Line (Operation).

F.	Balance left out hot metal available is dispatched to Cast House-A along with any adjustment required for handling of no. of ladles available with Pot Line (Operation) arising out of additional requirement raised or surplus metal available from Cast House-B and Rolling Plant Shops due to operational issues.

G.	Shift wise hot metal reconciliation between Pot Line (Operation) and Cast House is carried out on daily basis to tally the records with the quantity of the metal dispatched and received by the Cast House during the day against the metal planning made.

 
Problems:
The entire operation is manual as of now. There is no single window available for operation and coordination job. The transit time required between demand and supply involves various factors such as trip length, information on availability of vehicle, tracking of vehicle location. As a result, trucks may arrive later than the demanded time resulting in drop of loaded ladle metal temperature. All this leads to wastage of heat energy, longer wait time and longer metal truck haulage at times.

Moreover, Data portability, processing and reporting, all are manual. Hence a need for IOT based vehicle mounted pilot project which will save energy, time, etc. and help us greatly in avoiding chaos situations.

Improvements Desired:
To devise an IOT based vehicle mounted pilot project which shall ensure real time data connectivity on: 

Vehicle location tracking through LPS. (UWB  / RTLS / Indoor-Locating / LPS)
Information on availability of vehicle.
Live metal temperature data from ladle.
Vehicle call request with location.
Driver acknowledgement for call request.
Vehicle identification through code broadcast.

The proposed project will enable to achieve the following:

Reduced Metal Transporting Trucks turnaround time leading to lower haulage losses.
Reduced occurrences of ladle hot metal temperature drop due to smaller and faster haulage time.
More efficient control of vehicle logistics reducing chaos due to vehicle unavailability/in traceability.
Reduction of possibility of metal outage at either of Cast Houses, Rolling Plant.
Reduction in consumption of fuel oil required for reheating of liquid metal.

Operating temperature in a CT/MRI/PET exam room  is normally between 18deg C to 26 Deg C and kept on an average ~22Deg C. Since room temperature is lower than your body temperature, contact surface of medical device (mattress, pad, support surfaces etc..) quickly absorb the heat from patient’s skin, making patient feel cold. This discomfort to patient during medical imaging /Interventional procedures increases the negative patient outcome due to patient shivering & unintended patient motion. Due to this cold temperature, patients may activate “brown” fat at contact surface which contains adrenergic receptors and generates heat by metabolizing glucose. This can show up on scans and potentially hide true “lesions” in PET imaging.

Currently hospitals uses blankets to cover or to enfold a great portion of the Patient's body during scan to trap radiant bodily heat and keeping the body warm. Hospitals uses a lot of blankets as each patient requires a new / washed blanket.. busy centers will go through on avg. 10 blankets in a day.

" NALCO Smelter Plant has 04 Pot lines with 08 Pot Rooms and each Pot Room having 120 Pots. There are 2 Cast Houses and 1 Rolling Plant as well. Hot metal is tapped through Tapping Ladles from 960 pots and then transferred into transport ladles on the metal transporting trucks (MTT) for delivery to the desired Cast House Location as per the requisition made by the individual Cast Houses and Rolling Plant. 

 N.B:        	
•	Maximum 16 nos. of trucks can be deployed in the Pot Rooms.
•	The liquid metal is tapped at around 960°C.
•	The Cast House desired temperature range for metal casting 720°C-760°C.
•	If the metal arrives at little above the casting temperature value then it is ready for casting and no fuel is required to be burnt in the metal holding casting furnaces.

 
Operation:

A.	Cast House–A (Operation) prepares Metal Planning Schedule for 04 shifts on daily basis and forwards Hard/Soft Copy to Pot Line (Operation).

B.	After receipt of the metal planning schedule the Pot Line (Operation) shift-in-charge prepares tapping schedule for his shift.
  
C.	From the tapping schedule ladle schedule is derived along with the metal dispatch against requirement by Cast House (Operation).

D.	Accordingly MTT deployment by the Pot Line (Operation) transport section is arranged for each Pot Line Room Location to the respective Cast House in a Merry-go-Round fashion during the shift hours. 

E.	Normally Cast House-B and Rolling Plant forward their shift wise ladle requirement, in terms of no. of ladles required by them in a shift, initially to the Transport Section of Pot Line (Operation).

F.	Balance left out hot metal available is dispatched to Cast House-A along with any adjustment required for handling of no. of ladles available with Pot Line (Operation) arising out of additional requirement raised or surplus metal available from Cast House-B and Rolling Plant Shops due to operational issues.

G.	Shift wise hot metal reconciliation between Pot Line (Operation) and Cast House is carried out on daily basis to tally the records with the quantity of the metal dispatched and received by the Cast House during the day against the metal planning made.

 
Problems:
The entire operation is manual as of now. There is no single window available for operation and coordination job. The transit time required between demand and supply involves various factors such as trip length, information on availability of vehicle, tracking of vehicle location. As a result, trucks may arrive later than the demanded time resulting in drop of loaded ladle metal temperature. All this leads to wastage of heat energy, longer wait time and longer metal truck haulage at times.

Moreover, Data portability, processing and reporting, all are manual. Hence a need for IOT based vehicle mounted pilot project which will save energy, time, etc. and help us greatly in avoiding chaos situations.

Improvements Desired:
To devise an IOT based vehicle mounted pilot project which shall ensure real time data connectivity on: 

Vehicle location tracking through LPS. (UWB  / RTLS / Indoor-Locating / LPS)
Information on availability of vehicle.
Live metal temperature data from ladle.
Vehicle call request with location.
Driver acknowledgement for call request.
Vehicle identification through code broadcast.

The proposed project will enable to achieve the following:

Reduced Metal Transporting Trucks turnaround time leading to lower haulage losses.
Reduced occurrences of ladle hot metal temperature drop due to smaller and faster haulage time.
More efficient control of vehicle logistics reducing chaos due to vehicle unavailability/in traceability.
Reduction of possibility of metal outage at either of Cast Houses, Rolling Plant.
Reduction in consumption of fuel oil required for reheating of liquid metal.

" Humans normally maintain a body temperature at 37°C, and maintenance of this relatively high temperature is critical to human survival.  Our bodies are designed to tightly control our internal temperature, no matter what the external temperature is.

Operating temperature in a CT/MRI/PET exam room  is normally between 18deg C to 26 Deg C and kept on an average ~22Deg C. Since room temperature is lower than your body temperature, contact surface of medical device (mattress, pad, support surfaces etc..) quickly absorb the heat from patient’s skin, making patient feel cold. This discomfort to patient during medical imaging /Interventional procedures increases the negative patient outcome due to patient shivering & unintended patient motion. Due to this cold temperature, patients may activate “brown” fat at contact surface which contains adrenergic receptors and generates heat by metabolizing glucose. This can show up on scans and potentially hide true “lesions” in PET imaging.

Currently hospitals uses blankets to cover or to enfold a great portion of the Patient's body during scan to trap radiant bodily heat and keeping the body warm. Hospitals uses a lot of blankets as each patient requires a new / washed blanket.. busy centers will go through on avg. 10 blankets in a day.

" NALCO Smelter Plant has 04 Pot lines with 08 Pot Rooms and each Pot Room having 120 Pots. There are 2 Cast Houses and 1 Rolling Plant as well. Hot metal is tapped through Tapping Ladles from 960 pots and then transferred into transport ladles on the metal transporting trucks (MTT) for delivery to the desired Cast House Location as per the requisition made by the individual Cast Houses and Rolling Plant. 

 N.B:        	
•	Maximum 16 nos. of trucks can be deployed in the Pot Rooms.
•	The liquid metal is tapped at around 960°C.
•	The Cast House desired temperature range for metal casting 720°C-760°C.
•	If the metal arrives at little above the casting temperature value then it is ready for casting and no fuel is required to be burnt in the metal holding casting furnaces.

 
Operation:

A.	Cast House–A (Operation) prepares Metal Planning Schedule for 04 shifts on daily basis and forwards Hard/Soft Copy to Pot Line (Operation).

B.	After receipt of the metal planning schedule the Pot Line (Operation) shift-in-charge prepares tapping schedule for his shift.
  
C.	From the tapping schedule ladle schedule is derived along with the metal dispatch against requirement by Cast House (Operation).

D.	Accordingly MTT deployment by the Pot Line (Operation) transport section is arranged for each Pot Line Room Location to the respective Cast House in a Merry-go-Round fashion during the shift hours. 

E.	Normally Cast House-B and Rolling Plant forward their shift wise ladle requirement, in terms of no. of ladles required by them in a shift, initially to the Transport Section of Pot Line (Operation).

F.	Balance left out hot metal available is dispatched to Cast House-A along with any adjustment required for handling of no. of ladles available with Pot Line (Operation) arising out of additional requirement raised or surplus metal available from Cast House-B and Rolling Plant Shops due to operational issues.

G.	Shift wise hot metal reconciliation between Pot Line (Operation) and Cast House is carried out on daily basis to tally the records with the quantity of the metal dispatched and received by the Cast House during the day against the metal planning made.

 
Problems:
The entire operation is manual as of now. There is no single window available for operation and coordination job. The transit time required between demand and supply involves various factors such as trip length, information on availability of vehicle, tracking of vehicle location. As a result, trucks may arrive later than the demanded time resulting in drop of loaded ladle metal temperature. All this leads to wastage of heat energy, longer wait time and longer metal truck haulage at times.

Moreover, Data portability, processing and reporting, all are manual. Hence a need for IOT based vehicle mounted pilot project which will save energy, time, etc. and help us greatly in avoiding chaos situations.

Improvements Desired:
To devise an IOT based vehicle mounted pilot project which shall ensure real time data connectivity on: 

Vehicle location tracking through LPS. (UWB  / RTLS / Indoor-Locating / LPS)
Information on availability of vehicle.
Live metal temperature data from ladle.
Vehicle call request with location.
Driver acknowledgement for call request.
Vehicle identification through code broadcast.

The proposed project will enable to achieve the following:

Reduced Metal Transporting Trucks turnaround time leading to lower haulage losses.
Reduced occurrences of ladle hot metal temperature drop due to smaller and faster haulage time.
More efficient control of vehicle logistics reducing chaos due to vehicle unavailability/in traceability.
Reduction of possibility of metal outage at either of Cast Houses, Rolling Plant.
Reduction in consumption of fuel oil required for reheating of liquid metal.

" Humans normally maintain a body temperature at 37°C, and maintenance of this relatively high temperature is critical to human survival.  Our bodies are designed to tightly control our internal temperature, no matter what the external temperature is.

Operating temperature in a CT/MRI/PET exam room  is normally between 18deg C to 26 Deg C and kept on an average ~22Deg C. Since room temperature is lower than your body temperature, contact surface of medical device (mattress, pad, support surfaces etc..) quickly absorb the heat from patient’s skin, making patient feel cold. This discomfort to patient during medical imaging /Interventional procedures increases the negative patient outcome due to patient shivering & unintended patient motion. Due to this cold temperature, patients may activate “brown” fat at contact surface which contains adrenergic receptors and generates heat by metabolizing glucose. This can show up on scans and potentially hide true “lesions” in PET imaging.

Currently hospitals uses blankets to cover or to enfold a great portion of the Patient's body during scan to trap radiant bodily heat and keeping the body warm. Hospitals uses a lot of blankets as each patient requires a new / washed blanket.. busy centers will go through on avg. 10 blankets in a day. 
Key Constraints:

" NALCO Smelter Plant has 04 Pot lines with 08 Pot Rooms and each Pot Room having 120 Pots. There are 2 Cast Houses and 1 Rolling Plant as well. Hot metal is tapped through Tapping Ladles from 960 pots and then transferred into transport ladles on the metal transporting trucks (MTT) for delivery to the desired Cast House Location as per the requisition made by the individual Cast Houses and Rolling Plant. 

 N.B:        	
•	Maximum 16 nos. of trucks can be deployed in the Pot Rooms.
•	The liquid metal is tapped at around 960°C.
•	The Cast House desired temperature range for metal casting 720°C-760°C.
•	If the metal arrives at little above the casting temperature value then it is ready for casting and no fuel is required to be burnt in the metal holding casting furnaces.

 
Operation:

A.	Cast House–A (Operation) prepares Metal Planning Schedule for 04 shifts on daily basis and forwards Hard/Soft Copy to Pot Line (Operation).

B.	After receipt of the metal planning schedule the Pot Line (Operation) shift-in-charge prepares tapping schedule for his shift.
  
C.	From the tapping schedule ladle schedule is derived along with the metal dispatch against requirement by Cast House (Operation).

D.	Accordingly MTT deployment by the Pot Line (Operation) transport section is arranged for each Pot Line Room Location to the respective Cast House in a Merry-go-Round fashion during the shift hours. 

E.	Normally Cast House-B and Rolling Plant forward their shift wise ladle requirement, in terms of no. of ladles required by them in a shift, initially to the Transport Section of Pot Line (Operation).

F.	Balance left out hot metal available is dispatched to Cast House-A along with any adjustment required for handling of no. of ladles available with Pot Line (Operation) arising out of additional requirement raised or surplus metal available from Cast House-B and Rolling Plant Shops due to operational issues.

G.	Shift wise hot metal reconciliation between Pot Line (Operation) and Cast House is carried out on daily basis to tally the records with the quantity of the metal dispatched and received by the Cast House during the day against the metal planning made.

 
Problems:
The entire operation is manual as of now. There is no single window available for operation and coordination job. The transit time required between demand and supply involves various factors such as trip length, information on availability of vehicle, tracking of vehicle location. As a result, trucks may arrive later than the demanded time resulting in drop of loaded ladle metal temperature. All this leads to wastage of heat energy, longer wait time and longer metal truck haulage at times.

Moreover, Data portability, processing and reporting, all are manual. Hence a need for IOT based vehicle mounted pilot project which will save energy, time, etc. and help us greatly in avoiding chaos situations.

Improvements Desired:
To devise an IOT based vehicle mounted pilot project which shall ensure real time data connectivity on: 

Vehicle location tracking through LPS. (UWB  / RTLS / Indoor-Locating / LPS)
Information on availability of vehicle.
Live metal temperature data from ladle.
Vehicle call request with location.
Driver acknowledgement for call request.
Vehicle identification through code broadcast.

The proposed project will enable to achieve the following:

Reduced Metal Transporting Trucks turnaround time leading to lower haulage losses.
Reduced occurrences of ladle hot metal temperature drop due to smaller and faster haulage time.
More efficient control of vehicle logistics reducing chaos due to vehicle unavailability/in traceability.
Reduction of possibility of metal outage at either of Cast Houses, Rolling Plant.
Reduction in consumption of fuel oil required for reheating of liquid metal.

We could potentially use Drones for last mile delivery of items. While current prevalent addressing mechanism such as lat/long and post code are good enough for humans, these won’t work for drone delivery as all houses in a multi-storey building will have same lat/long or post-code.

" BACKGROUND: 
Traffic control for the people, by the people”. The smart phone-based Application captures the traffic flout and directly share it with traffic control team. App will have information about Traffic rules with best user interactive appearance. App will reduce Burden on traffic control team.  

PROBLEM STATEMENT: The traffic is huge problem in metro cities in India and to monitor it throughout a day it’s the difficult task. The Traffic control and monitoring team can control this up to certain extent. However, the main responsibilities lie on individual. The simple smart phone-based application has capability to record the rule breaking and flout traffic situation which will be shared with traffic control team (Traffic Police). In current situation, the traffic control team uses a camera to capture people with flouting traffic rules and along with this they have to control the city traffic too. It is difficult for them to keep an eye on both the activities at a time. To reduce their workload, an individual can install this app and will be able to share the evidence with traffic control team.  The awareness of this app will lead an individual to follow traffic rule strictly in order to avoid mistakes done by others. The app will have traffic rule guidelines which will help an individual to learn more about traffic rules. The app will provide credit to user on capturing valid traffic flout. The App can cover large scale to small scale Traffic rule evades (e. g. No Parking, Pedestrian crossing evades). Each individual can contribute toward traffic control, awareness, and behavior of individual toward traffic rules.   

OUTCOME EXPECTED: 
1. Application runs on Android and IOS app which is directly integrated with traffic control team.  
2. Distributed way of traffic maintenance.
