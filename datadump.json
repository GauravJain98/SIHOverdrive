For the purpose of the Challenge, defined sepsis according to the Sepsis-3 guidelines, i.e., a two-point change in the patient's Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score and clinical suspicion of infection (as defined by the ordering of blood cultures or IV antibiotics) (Singer et al., 2016).\nThe early prediction of sepsis is potentially life-saving, and challenging participants to predict sepsis 6 hours before the clinical prediction of sepsis. Conversely, the late prediction of sepsis is potentially life-threatening, and predicting sepsis in non-sepsis patients (or predicting sepsis very early in sepsis patients) consumes limited hospital resources.\nDevelop a digital solution that uses artificial intelligence to detect patient deterioration before it\u2019s too late and trigger notifications to clinicians and care teams. Train healthcare providers and front-line staff to quickly recognize symptoms to identify sepsis and treat patients at the earliest. Also, educate preventing infections in health care settings and in the community so that infections that can lead to sepsis can be stopped before they happen. Provide guidelines to follow infection control requirements (e.g., Hand hygiene) and ensure one to receive recommended vaccines (e.g., Flu and pneumococcal, etc.).\nAbstract\nSepsis is a life-threatening condition that occurs when the body's response to infection causes tissue damage, organ failure, or death (Singer et al., 2016). In the U.S., nearly 1.7 million people develop sepsis and 270,000 people die from sepsis each year; over one third of people who die in U.S. hospitals have sepsis (CDC). Internationally, an estimated 30 million people develop sepsis and 6 million people die from sepsis each year; an estimated 4.2 million newborns and children are affected (WHO). Sepsis costs U.S. hospitals more than any other health condition at $24 billion (13% of U.S. healthcare expenses) a year, and a majority of these costs are for sepsis patients that were not diagnosed at admission (Paoli et al., 2018). Sepsis costs are even greater globally with the developing world at most risk. Altogether, sepsis is a major public health issue responsible for significant morbidity, mortality, and healthcare expenses.\nEarly detection and antibiotic treatment of sepsis are critical for improving sepsis outcomes, where each hour of delayed treatment has been associated with roughly an 4-8% increase in mortality (Kumar et al., 2006; Seymour et al., 2017). To help address this problem, clinicians have proposed new definitions for sepsis (Singer et al., 2016), but the fundamental need to detect and treat sepsis early still remains, and basic questions about the limits of early detection remain unanswered. data set https://physionet.org/content/challenge-2019/1.0.0/", "youtube": "", "dataset_link": ""}}, {"model": "mainApp.problemstatement", "pk": 12, "fields": {"archived": false, "created_at": "2019-12-21T17:19:28.725Z", "updated_at": "2019-12-24T18:33:50.002Z", "img": "https://www.sih.gov.in/uploads/logo/no_image.png", "organization": "TCI", "category": "Software", "ps_number": "PU131", "title": "PREDICTION OF TARIFF RATE", "domain_bucket": "Miscellaneous", "description": " 1.\tProject Statement\nTo predict the tariff rate for next session (monthly/weekly/daily/hourly) for part truck load (Sundry and LTL).\n2.\tProject Scope\n The predicting system must include the following:\n\u2022\tAbility to predict tariff rate for sundry based on historical data\n\u2022\tAbility to incorporate external factors listed under factors heading below\n\u2022\tAbility to incorporate automated routing and notifications based on existing business rules\n3.\tDeliverables\n The project is for TCI Freight division.

A network routing protocol is scalable in terms of number of nodes when it can accommodate additional nodes without increase of overhead for given limited area. The conceptualizedMANET protocolshall establish the source to destination path similar to zone routing protocols (ZRP). The path to destination is referred at source, in terms of the geological zones therefore allowing movement of intermediate mobile devices across path without disturbing the path. The devices get assigned new zone automatically using the GPS. The simulation scenario shall be source node is searching a path to friendly destination device, exchange data (hello) and drop the link. The devices follow random mobility pattern in 2 D frame. For searching of devices there is pre condition of knowing past history or pattern or set of fixed zones where destination node can reside. This is close to real world scenario where destinations reside at known zonessuch as home, office, commutation route, friend\u2019s place, entertainment hub in area, railway station, airport etc. The MANET protocol, by nature of precondition, of knowing the possibility of location of devices; protects from spam connection and un authorized network broadcast. It is allowed ato modify the protocol to certain level to improve security, privacy without diluting the basic principal. The simulation is required to test the claim of scalability level in terms of N devices in simulation. A set of software codes will be required to be developed for simulation of the routing protocol.The simulation can be done using open source network simulator. It is required to test and simulate the concept of this routing protocol and its scalability. The metric of scalability will be success in search, establish and dropping the links between pairs of devices and amount of information shared when not having links. The largest possible MANET size is required to be order of 1000s. All MANET devices shall be interchangeable and there will not be any infrastructure dedicated node.

As researchers are used to accessing websites (whether in their personal or professional lives) that respond to their screen size and are optimized for mobile, but also contain ideal user experience elements to make it easy to navigate (think single search bar front and center, clear organization of content etc.). \nb.\tUploading research, discovery of and access to information:  It should be a user-friendly research portal wherein the researchers can search and discover the right information and content for their work. They also be able to upload their research work university/college/miscellaneous wise which may further be categorized department/areas of study wise. \n\nA discovery service is the next tool to consider integrating into research portal. Consider how metadata is used, the methodology around searching and retrieving search results, how the tool anticipates users\u2019 needs, and what can be integrated into the discovery tool. \n\nc.\tAuthentication: As research and collection of information resources become increasingly digital, authentication will be a key component to ensure the security of users and their content.

There is no single window available for operation and coordination job. The transit time required between demand and supply involves various factors such as trip length, information on availability of vehicle, tracking of vehicle location. As a result, trucks may arrive later than the demanded time resulting in drop of loaded ladle metal temperature.

The Traffic control and monitoring team can control this up to certain extent. However, the main responsibilities lie on individual. The simple smart phone-based application has capability to record the rule breaking and flout traffic situation which will be shared with traffic control team (Traffic Police). In current situation, the traffic control team uses a camera to capture people with flouting traffic rules and along with this they have to control the city traffic too. It is difficult for them to keep an eye on both the activities at a time. To reduce their workload, an individual can install this app and will be able to share the evidence with traffic control team.  The awareness of this app will lead an individual to follow traffic rule strictly in order to avoid mistakes done by others. The app will have traffic rule guidelines which will help an individual to learn more about traffic rules. The app will provide credit to user on capturing valid traffic flout. The App can cover large scale to small scale Traffic rule evades (e. g. No Parking, Pedestrian crossing evades). Each individual can contribute toward traffic control, awareness, and behavior of individual toward traffic rules.   \n\nOUTCOME EXPECTED: \n1. Application runs on Android and IOS app which is directly integrated with traffic control team.  \n2.

With proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) devices and sensor. Cisco can play a big role automating alerts and actions in buildings, campuses or cities. Student teams are expected to develop a protocol to have a communication with the IoT sensors and transfer the relevant data. Solution Expected: Build a multi-protocol application would truly help realize the vision of IoT with devices that span across use cases and cost points, and deliver meaningful impact on social initiatives such as Swachh Bharat\u201d One such example could be the following: a smart garbage sensor connecting over a LoRa protocol to the wireless Access Point and a Docker based application executing on the Access Point sensing that the garbage can may be full and needs attention. Upon making such an inference, the application may choose to unlock a Zigbee lock attached to the door as well as turning on a Zigbee light in the location closest to the garbage bin. Such a multi-protocol application would truly help realize the vision of IoT with devices that span across use cases and cost points, and deliver meaningful impact on social initiatives such as Swachh Bharat\u201d Tech recommendation: Cisco latest generation of Wi-Fi 6 access points - the Catalyst 9120 is truly multi-lingual with diverse radio capabilities to address the needs of a fragmented world of IoT protocols. In addition to delivering Wi-Fi, the 9120 AP also delivers Bluetooth 5.0, Zigbee, and Thread capabilities with the ability to add other radios via a USB interface. The Catalyst 9120 AP also has the unique capability of executing Docker-style containerized applications that could make use of the IoT radios and deliver use cases through a unified wireless infrastructure for customers, thereby reducing cost and complexity. Cisco would love you to think audaciously about other problem statements and use cases that can leverage such a converged wireless multi-protocol capability with containerized edge applications. Cisco look forward to seeing your creations! Applications can be prototyped using a Raspberry Pi with 2 different radios. The evaluations shall be based on the following criteria 1.

There is no single window available for operation and coordination job. The transit time required between demand and supply involves various factors such as trip length, information on availability of vehicle, tracking of vehicle location. As a result, trucks may arrive later than the demanded time resulting in drop of loaded ladle metal temperature.

The Traffic control and monitoring team can control this up to certain extent. However, the main responsibilities lie on individual. The simple smart phone-based application has capability to record the rule breaking and flout traffic situation which will be shared with traffic control team (Traffic Police). In current situation, the traffic control team uses a camera to capture people with flouting traffic rules and along with this they have to control the city traffic too. It is difficult for them to keep an eye on both the activities at a time. To reduce their workload, an individual can install this app and will be able to share the evidence with traffic control team.  The awareness of this app will lead an individual to follow traffic rule strictly in order to avoid mistakes done by others. The app will have traffic rule guidelines which will help an individual to learn more about traffic rules. The app will provide credit to user on capturing valid traffic flout. The App can cover large scale to small scale Traffic rule evades (e. g. No Parking, Pedestrian crossing evades). Each individual can contribute toward traffic control, awareness, and behavior of individual toward traffic rules.   \n\nOUTCOME EXPECTED: \n1.

With proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) devices and sensor. Cisco can play a big role automating alerts and actions in buildings, campuses or cities. Student teams are expected to develop a protocol to have a communication with the IoT sensors and transfer the relevant data. Solution Expected: Build a multi-protocol application would truly help realize the vision of IoT with devices that span across use cases and cost points, and deliver meaningful impact on social initiatives such as Swachh Bharat\u201d One such example could be the following: a smart garbage sensor connecting over a LoRa protocol to the wireless Access Point and a Docker based application executing on the Access Point sensing that the garbage can may be full and needs attention. Upon making such an inference, the application may choose to unlock a Zigbee lock attached to the door as well as turning on a Zigbee light in the location closest to the garbage bin. Such a multi-protocol application would truly help realize the vision of IoT with devices that span across use cases and cost points, and deliver meaningful impact on social initiatives such as Swachh Bharat\u201d Tech recommendation: Cisco latest generation of Wi-Fi 6 access points - the Catalyst 9120 is truly multi-lingual with diverse radio capabilities to address the needs of a fragmented world of IoT protocols. In addition to delivering Wi-Fi, the 9120 AP also delivers Bluetooth 5.0, Zigbee, and Thread capabilities with the ability to add other radios via a USB interface. The Catalyst 9120 AP also has the unique capability of executing Docker-style containerized applications that could make use of the IoT radios and deliver use cases through a unified wireless infrastructure for customers, thereby reducing cost and complexity. Cisco would love you to think audaciously about other problem statements and use cases that can leverage such a converged wireless multi-protocol capability with containerized edge applications. Cisco look forward to seeing your creations! Applications can be prototyped using a Raspberry Pi with 2 different radios. The evaluations shall be based on the following criteria 1. Depth and research to understand how technology can be used for Swachh Bharat Abhiyan (SBA) 2. Depth of understanding of Cisco 9120 AP product capabilities & use cases. 3. Depth and understanding of technologies proposed in solution.\n\nResources:\u00a0\n\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/collateral/wireless/catalyst-9120ax-series-\naccess-points/datasheet-c78-742115.html", "youtube": "", "dataset_link": ""}}, {"model": "mainApp.problemstatement", "pk": 250, "fields": {"archived": false, "created_at": "2019-12-24T18:21:57.524Z", "updated_at": "2019-12-24T18:21:57.524Z", "img": "https://www.sih.gov.in/uploads/logo/no_image.png", "organization": "Bharat Forge Ltd", "category": "Hardware", "ps_number": "SP292", "title": "Design and Development of working prototype of Helicopter Turbo-propellers", "domain_bucket": "Robotics & Drones", "description": " Before fully functional helicopters, in 1960's people are using helicopter turbo-propellers for vertical takeoff and landing of planes.

There is no single window available for operation and coordination job. The transit time required between demand and supply involves various factors such as trip length, information on availability of vehicle, tracking of vehicle location. As a result, trucks may arrive later than the demanded time resulting in drop of loaded ladle metal temperature.

The Traffic control and monitoring team can control this up to certain extent. However, the main responsibilities lie on individual. The simple smart phone-based application has capability to record the rule breaking and flout traffic situation which will be shared with traffic control team (Traffic Police). In current situation, the traffic control team uses a camera to capture people with flouting traffic rules and along with this they have to control the city traffic too. It is difficult for them to keep an eye on both the activities at a time. To reduce their workload, an individual can install this app and will be able to share the evidence with traffic control team.  The awareness of this app will lead an individual to follow traffic rule strictly in order to avoid mistakes done by others. The app will have traffic rule guidelines which will help an individual to learn more about traffic rules. The app will provide credit to user on capturing valid traffic flout.

With proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) devices and sensor. Cisco can play a big role automating alerts and actions in buildings, campuses or cities. Student teams are expected to develop a protocol to have a communication with the IoT sensors and transfer the relevant data. Solution Expected: Build a multi-protocol application would truly help realize the vision of IoT with devices that span across use cases and cost points, and deliver meaningful impact on social initiatives such as Swachh Bharat\u201d One such example could be the following: a smart garbage sensor connecting over a LoRa protocol to the wireless Access Point and a Docker based application executing on the Access Point sensing that the garbage can may be full and needs attention. Upon making such an inference, the application may choose to unlock a Zigbee lock attached to the door as well as turning on a Zigbee light in the location closest to the garbage bin. Such a multi-protocol application would truly help realize the vision of IoT with devices that span across use cases and cost points, and deliver meaningful impact on social initiatives such as Swachh Bharat\u201d Tech recommendation: Cisco latest generation of Wi-Fi 6 access points - the Catalyst 9120 is truly multi-lingual with diverse radio capabilities to address the needs of a fragmented world of IoT protocols. In addition to delivering Wi-Fi, the 9120 AP also delivers Bluetooth 5.0, Zigbee, and Thread capabilities with the ability to add other radios via a USB interface. The Catalyst 9120 AP also has the unique capability of executing Docker-style containerized applications that could make use of the IoT radios and deliver use cases through a unified wireless infrastructure for customers, thereby reducing cost and complexity. Cisco would love you to think audaciously about other problem statements and use cases that can leverage such a converged wireless multi-protocol capability with containerized edge applications. Cisco look forward to seeing your creations! Applications can be prototyped using a Raspberry Pi with 2 different radios. The evaluations shall be based on the following criteria 1. Depth and research to understand how technology can be used for Swachh Bharat Abhiyan (SBA) 2. Depth of understanding of Cisco 9120 AP product capabilities & use cases. 3.

Smart grids which integrate both conventional energy sources and renewable sources are envisioned to be a sustainable power generation solution. However, all sources of renewable energy are affected by environmental factors (such as wind speed, intensity of solar radiation, cloud cover) which causes fluctuations in power generated from these sources. Also, the availability are subjected to daily/annual cycles (eg. Solar energy available during daytime only). While smart metering enables real-time demand forecasting; accurate models that forecast power generated by renewable energy sources are also needed.  Accurate forecasting models will ensure grid stability, smooth scheduling and energy management.  For instance, if the model forecasts renewable energy outage for a certain duration of time, the smart grid must seamlessly switch to the conventional energy source for that duration and ensure that the generated power meets the demand forecast.  Literature proposes various learning-based forecasting models for renewable energy sources based on open data sources; as well as scheduling strategies for demand-supply matching. Further, simulation software to realistically model microgrids are also available. The problem defined here is to come up with a framework which: realistically simulates a microgrid; forecasts demand and supply of (renewable) energy; seamlessly schedules supply of renewable (and conventional energy) to meet the demand; and provides actionable insights about the functioning of the smart grid system.\n\nPROBLEM STATEMENT:\n1.\tSimulate the microgrid/utility system with various consumers and prosumers.\n2.\tFor the renewable energy sources, using environment time series data from open data forums-develop energy generation forecasting models. \n3.\tFor the consumers/prosumers using energy consumption time series data from open data forums-develop energy demand forecasting models. \n4.\tDevelop scheduling algorithms for the utility/microgrid controller.\n5.\tIntegrate the forecasting model and scheduler with the simulation setup in 1.\n6.\tPrototype the following use case with developed models: \nAn Integrated Smart Grid utility manager would want to remotely monitor the operations of the deployed system in real-time.

When stored in tanks, these fluids tend to stick inside the tanks forming layers of semi-solid substance. Moreover, many impurities of these fluids settle down and stick to the surface of the tanks. It is therefore imperative that the tanks are cleaned on a regular basis on ships.\nGenerally, tanks cleaning on the ship is done during dry dock and whenever the inspection of the tanks is due. Cleaning is done for inspection or if there is any work to be done inside the tanks such as cracks, leaks, etc.\nTank cleaning inspection and repairs is a necessary procedure performed on board ships. This process, when carried out by humans, tends to be hazardous, sometimes leading to explosion and accidents. In spite of all the necessary safety precautions and enclosed space entry procedures, accidents still occur while inspecting, cleaning and repairing tanks on board ships.\n\n(b)\tHow it is being Overcome.\n\nThe problem is, at present, being overcome by ventilating the tanks and use of personnel protective gears. However, the atmosphere in the tanks still remains unsatisfactory and continues to pose health hazards for human beings.\n\nThe following procedure is followed before making an entry for tank cleaning: -\n\u2022\tFluid Contents of the tank should be removed as practicable as possible and stripped thoroughly before entering.\n\u2022\tVentilate the tank using thorough ventilation or forced ventilation method and make the tank suitable for man entry.\n\u2022\tBefore making a man entry, the atmosphere of the tank is tested for percentage of oxygen and availability of any toxic gases. This has to be done using remote access if possible, otherwise the person entering the tank for testing atmosphere must wear a breathing apparatus.\n\u2022\tVarious levels and compartments of tank is tested for the percentage of oxygen and availability of toxic gases. A multi gas analyser is used and a person who is trained and has the knowledge of using such equipment carries out the inspection.\nOnce the tank is found safe for man entry, workers enter the tank and carry out cleaning, inspection, repairs etc. Working within these constrained spaces is hazardous, in spite of all the safety precautions.\n4.\tWhy it is Important to Solve.  \n\nEffective solution of this problem is critical to avoid \n(a)\ttime delays in inspecting, cleaning and repairing tanks \n(b)\taccidents which still occur inside the tanks on board ships. \n(c)\tmanpower cost.\n\n5.\tSuggested Solutions. \n\nThe problem can be resolved by developing a mechanism like a robotic arm with the following attachments:\n(a)\tGas analyser for checking the percentage of oxygen and presence of toxic gases, \n(b)\tCamera for inspection of tank and examination of defect.\n(c)\tCleaning Attachment\n(d)\tRepair attachments\n(e)\tQuality Inspection Equipment\n\nThe robotic arm should be amenable for reliable operation on a ship and capable of entering the tanks and reaching all areas within. It should have programmable operations like horizontal movement, vertical movement, speed adjustment, single or multistage operation at any desired length and angle range, etc. It should be light enough to carry within the constraints of a ship, with fixing arrangements that match with arrangements on-board ship.", "youtube": "", "dataset_link": ""}}, {"model": "mainApp.problemstatement", "pk": 273, "fields": {"archived": false, "created_at": "2020-01-08T21:04:18.369Z", "updated_at": "2020-01-08T21:04:18.369Z", "img": "https://www.sih.gov.in/uploads/logo/20181127184902.jpg", "organization": "VMware Software India Pvt.Ltd.", "category": "Software", "ps_number": "SS443", "title": "Electric Vehicle (EV) Ecosystem", "domain_bucket": "Software - Web App development", "description": " Electric Vehicle (EV) will be the vehicle of choice soon.

If the vibration increases above the permissible limits, it might lead to the failure of these structures and machines. Thus, it is very important to continuously monitor the vibration of a critical structure or machine. Vibration can be expressed in terms of its amplitude and frequency. Laser based vibration measurement has gained importance due to its non-contact, non-destructive nature and fast speed. Laser Vibrometer is based on optical triangulation technique. In Triangulation technique for vibration measurement, visible laser beam emitted from a diode laser strikes the target and the backscattered light is collected by suitable optics to focus on a position sensitive detector (PSD). Laser source, target and focusing optics form a triangle. The position of focused spot on the detector is related to the distance of the target from the sensor thus displacement of focused spot on detector is related to the displacement of the target from its equilibrium position. The PSD converts optical signal into electrical signal. Thus a vibration displacement signal in electrical form is generated by the sensor, which corresponds to mechanical vibration of the target. For simple harmonic motion, an optical triangulation based displacement sensors generate a sinusoidal signal whose frequency corresponds to frequency of vibration.\nLaser vibrometer uses low power Laser diode as light source. The instrument consists in two parts \nI.\tSensor, consisting of Laser light source (Diode Laser), optical system (Focusing lens) to collect the back-scattered light after it has interacted with the object, detection system consisting of opto-electronic device (PSD) and analog electronic circuit to process the detector output and generate \u00b15V output corresponding to \u00b15 mm displacement of the object. This analog voltage is to be digitized and then transmitted using blue tooth technology to the nearest mobile phone.\nII.\tAn application program on mobile phone will receive the dynamic displacement data from laser sensor and computes the FFT of the signal. This calculated FFT spectrum will carry the amplitude and frequency contents of the vibration. The calculated frequency spectrum is to be displayed in graphical form on the mobile screen and important parameters like dominant frequencies and their amplitude will be extracted from the spectrum and separately displayed.\nThus the problem consists of development of compact laser sensor with wireless transmission capability, battery operated and size of the palm for vibration measurement. Then development of suitable Android based  mobile app to communicate to the sensor and display frequency spectrum and important vibration parameters on mobile screen.", "youtube": "", "dataset_link": ""}}, {"model": "mainApp.problemstatement", "pk": 300, "fields": {"archived": false, "created_at": "2020-01-08T21:04:19.403Z", "updated_at": "2020-01-08T21:04:19.403Z", "img": "https://www.sih.gov.in/uploads/logo/20191014230506.png", "organization": "Department of Atomic Energy", "category": "Hardware", "ps_number": "PC88", "title": "Generalized Epileptic Seizure Alert System", "domain_bucket": "Healthcare & Biomedical Devices", "description": " Epilepsy is a central nervous system (neurological) disorder in which brain activity becomes abnormal, causing seizures or periods of unusual behavior, sensations, and sometimes loss of awareness. Of the 70 million persons with epilepsy (PWE) worldwide, nearly 12 million PWE are expected to reside in India; which contributes to nearly one-sixth of the global burden. Epilepsy often manifests itself in childhood and is a cause of immense concern for the parents who are often kept on their toes anticipating the next seizure event. This causes psychological and health concerns amongst the primary caregivers who often stay awake through the night in anticipation. Seizures are of many kind with the most prevalent being generalized tonic-clonic seizures. A generalized tonic-clonic seizure, sometimes called a grand mal seizure, is a disturbance in the functioning of both sides of the brain. This disturbance is caused by electrical signals spreading through the brain inappropriately. Often this will result in signals being sent to the muscles, nerves, or glands. The spread of these signals in the brain can make one lose consciousness and have severe muscle contractions.The aim of this project is to develop a battery powered, low cost, portable generalized tonic-clonic seizure alert device which can notify nearby family members or caregivers when a seizure occurs through alarms, phone calls or text alerts, depending on the device. A caregiver can then help the person during and after the seizure. For example, they can help reposition the person, making sure they are on their side if they are not conscious. They can also make sure someone doesn\u2019t fall asleep on their stomach afterwards. If breathing or other problems occur, they can call for medical help. They may also be able to give rescue medications or call for an ambulance if the seizure lasts too long or the person has repeated seizures. The project aims at using Inertial Measurement Unit/tri axial accelerometer as the primary sensing unit coupled with advanced signal processing and machine learning techniques to detect abnormal motions akin to seizures in the patients body. The proposed instrument shall also consist of heartbeat monitoring system for additional analytics related to sleep quality monitoring. The project has significant hardware and software challenges which includes accurate measurement and classification of jerking motions, continuous low power heart rate monitoring, signal processing and machine learning algorithms at a very low power budget. The proposed device will reduce burden on the primary caregivers or family members who often spend sleepless nights anticipating the seizure event.", "youtube": "", "dataset_link": ""}}, {"model": "mainApp.problemstatement", "pk": 301, "fields": {"archived": false, "created_at": "2020-01-08T21:04:19.444Z", "updated_at": "2020-01-08T21:04:19.444Z", "img": "https://www.sih.gov.in/uploads/logo/20191014230506.png", "organization": "Department of Atomic Energy", "category": "Hardware", "ps_number": "PC89", "title": "Digital Imaging of Objects behind Steel walls", "domain_bucket": "Security & Surveillance", "description": " Steel is a widely used material for fabrication of machinery and equipment in almost all the industries. Maintenance of these equipment may become very expensive and time consuming if it requires de-assembling, inspection and then re-assembling. So, an innovative technology can be developed which will help in machinery inspection in assembled condition by digitally imaging all the objects inside it like X-Rays for human body. This will help in identifying the cause of the malfunction of the machinery and necessary action can be taken. Solution methodology - Light waves can pass through glass walls and reflect from the objects behind it. This makes us able to see through a glass wall. Similarly, some other EM waves can pass through concrete walls. There are already many technological developments going on worldwide to use this fact to locate objects behind the concrete walls. Even, moving human body can be detected behind concrete wall upto certain distance using available technology. As EM waves cannot pass through steel walls, use of sound waves/ultrasound can be explored. Instrumentation developed (both software and hardware) should be able to detect either the sound waves generated behind steel wall or send a known sound pulse and get its echo reflected from the objects behind the wall. Developed technology can be envisaged as the multiple microphones mounted on many locations on the machinery to detect and locate the position of the object generating sound. Final outcome -  A set of compatible hardware and software is to be developed which will be able to detect and locate either the source of sound or create a digital imaging of all the objects behind the steel wall. There should be provision of adjusting the frequency transmitted and received by sensors to consider varying thickness of the wall and material of objects behind it. Challenges - Since wave propagation inside the machinery involves very little distance, time difference obtained from various objects behind the steel wall is supposed to be very less.

But unfortunately most of the time, the observer may forget to change the bottle at correct time due to their busy schedule.To overcome this critical situation, a IoT based automatic alerting and indicating device is proposed where sensor is used as a level sensor or weight sensor. It is based on the principle that the sensor output changes when fluid level/weight is below certain limit. When Fluid level/weight is low, will alerts the observer through the display or/and mobile phone at the control room indicates the room number of the patient for quick recovery Hospital uses simple electrolytes bottles with no indication, it may create a problem to patient because the reverse flow will start, blood start to flow from body towards bottle. In, Hospital ICU, CCU, NICU, OPD, OT, most of all department of hospital required such kind of automatic monitoring and indication system. Also Health care industries will one of the users. such monitoring system can be useful in small , medium and large size of hospitals and also it useful during home care. If such a monitoring system builds, it will decrease the chances of patients hazards and increases the accuracy of health care in hospital. In future we can design a ready mate portable cover system for such bottle. Ready mate Wearable sensors on sides of bottle can detect level/weight of-fluid inside bottles. Such data can also send to nurses and/or doctor`s mobile and they can start or stop the fluid and also monitoring fluid condition, such things required security password also. Hospital staff, the constant need to manually monitor the level of bottles is avoided. This is of high advantage to the patients especially during night times. This system also avoids the fatal risk of air bubbles entering the patient\u2019s bloodstream, which is a serious threat as air bubbles in blood can cause immediate death.

Emergency vehicle may be ambulance or fire-fighting equipment carrying vehicle, police van or disaster management vehicle. In emergency situation, vehicle should reach in time at proper destination but unfortunately traffic situation block that vehicle. In emergency situation like severe heat attack, pregnancy , accident, fire etc. it is necessary for a vehicle to reach at the destination in short time. In medical emergency, it is necessary to provide emergency medical treatment to the patient. It is necessary to reach at nearest and best hospital in time. Most of cities and even district place are having problem of traffic and due to which ambulance and other emergency vehicles are not getting free route to reach at the destination. Other Emergency occurs anywhere at any location, at any time, and in various ways will make one at risk such as fire. Fire fighting vehicle must reach in time to save life and property.
