" Insurance has typically been a push product where the customer is usually sold an insurance by the agents. This makes the product marketing/ sales cost too high due to low conversion rates on insurance sales. It can be said that two factors contribute to this:
1.	Insurance being viewed as an expense rather than a protection 
2.	The long and non-engaging information capture process which is required to issue the insurance.

" The goal of this Challenge is the early detection of sepsis using physiological data. For the purpose of the Challenge, defined sepsis according to the Sepsis-3 guidelines, i.e., a two-point change in the patient's Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score and clinical suspicion of infection (as defined by the ordering of blood cultures or IV antibiotics) (Singer et al., 2016).
The early prediction of sepsis is potentially life-saving, and challenging participants to predict sepsis 6 hours before the clinical prediction of sepsis. Conversely, the late prediction of sepsis is potentially life-threatening, and predicting sepsis in non-sepsis patients (or predicting sepsis very early in sepsis patients) consumes limited hospital resources.
Develop a digital solution that uses artificial intelligence to detect patient deterioration before it’s too late and trigger notifications to clinicians and care teams. Train healthcare providers and front-line staff to quickly recognize symptoms to identify sepsis and treat patients at the earliest. Also, educate preventing infections in health care settings and in the community so that infections that can lead to sepsis can be stopped before they happen. Provide guidelines to follow infection control requirements (e.g., Hand hygiene) and ensure one to receive recommended vaccines (e.g., Flu and pneumococcal, etc.).
Abstract
Sepsis is a life-threatening condition that occurs when the body's response to infection causes tissue damage, organ failure, or death (Singer et al., 2016). In the U.S., nearly 1.7 million people develop sepsis and 270,000 people die from sepsis each year; over one third of people who die in U.S. hospitals have sepsis (CDC). Internationally, an estimated 30 million people develop sepsis and 6 million people die from sepsis each year; an estimated 4.2 million newborns and children are affected (WHO). Sepsis costs U.S. hospitals more than any other health condition at $24 billion (13% of U.S. healthcare expenses) a year, and a majority of these costs are for sepsis patients that were not diagnosed at admission (Paoli et al., 2018). Sepsis costs are even greater globally with the developing world at most risk. Altogether, sepsis is a major public health issue responsible for significant morbidity, mortality, and healthcare expenses.
Early detection and antibiotic treatment of sepsis are critical for improving sepsis outcomes, where each hour of delayed treatment has been associated with roughly an 4-8% increase in mortality (Kumar et al., 2006; Seymour et al., 2017). To help address this problem, clinicians have proposed new definitions for sepsis (Singer et al., 2016), but the fundamental need to detect and treat sepsis early still remains, and basic questions about the limits of early detection remain unanswered. data set https://physionet.org/content/challenge-2019/1.0.0/",,Early Prediction of Sepsis from Clinical Data,GE Healthcare,Software,UP49,Healthcare & Biomedical Devices,https://www.sih.gov.in/uploads/logo/20181128160812.jpg

" Tourism in India is important for the country economy and is growing rapidly. The sector is predicted to grow at an annual rate of 6.9% to rupees 32.05 lakh crore(US$460 billion) by 2028 (9.9% of GDP). In October 2015, India medical tourism sector was estimated to be worth US$3 billion, and it is projected to grow to US$7–8 billion by 2020. In 2014, 184,298 foreign patients traveled to India to seek medical treatment.Students teams are expected to develop a context-based NLP engine to guide the tourists using MindMeld capabilities. MindMeld is a platform to power the next generation of chat and voice assistants. It is an AI platform for building conversational interfaces.

Solution Expected: 

The requirements are to develop a WebEx Team bot capable of NLP to guide tourists. Student teams can choose any one from some of the scenarios that we have listed below. Tourism can be classified into the following sectors and provide help based on the nature of tourism.
1. Cruise Tourism - An itinerary Manager that proposes day-by-day schedule of the cruise with a complete list of attractions at each place along with the route navigation system.
2. Adventure Tourism - Since its adventures the bot must provide a tailor-made experience offering a personalized answer and suitable options based on the situations along with appropriate reminders based on the tourist spot visited. The old-fashioned concept of showcasing only India historical heritage and monuments is changing and people around the world are more interested in ecotourism where they want to see the local flora and fauna. Increasing tourism in the Sundarbans area in West Bengal is an attractive proposition. The region contains the biggest mangrove forest in the world and exotic flora and fauna and the Royal Bengal Tiger.

" The Mid-day Meal Scheme is a school meal programme of the Government of India and is designed to improve the nutritional standing of school-age children nationwide. The programme supplies free lunches on working days for children in primary and upper primary classes in Government schools. Serving 120,000,000 children in over 1,265,000 schools and Education Guarantee Scheme centers, it is the largest of its kind in the world. Student teams are expected to build machine vision solution to monitor the activities under the Mid-day Meal Scheme. 

Solution Expected: 
As the Mid-Day Meal program runs in schools across the country, continuous auditing and monitoring of the program might be challenging. 
Typical Auditing and Monitoring could involve: 
Ensuring number of students that took meal is same number reported. Lunch served is same as published/reported menu. Alerting in case of discrepancy and capability to centrally see past records / proof (numbers and visual) for any school. To design modules based on the above mentioned activities, video feed shall be provided to the student teams. These feeds shall come from the Meraki security camera. Typically, these shall come from the actual / imitated site i.e. schools, food serving area etc. Student teams are expected to explore the capabilities of Meraki camera’s inbuilt Machine learning (ML) modules and develop solutions around it. E.g. counting students, object recognition etc. Meraki security camera also has an inbuilt functionality to capture snapshot photos. Teams are expected to generate their own database based on the region of interest and features they wish to extract to develop ML models. Along with the expectations of Auditing & Monitoring the student teams should also propose innovative ideas (backed with research) to extract additional information from above snapshots / photos. While architecting the entire system, teams may explore the scalability factor of the system. 

The evaluations shall be based on the following criteria: 

1. Depth and research to understand Mid-Day meal scheme monitoring problem. 
2. Depth of understanding of Meraki camera product capabilities use cases. 
3. Depth and understanding of technologies proposed in solution.

" Search and Rescue (SAR) is an operation to find and rescue the people in distress. SAR operations aim at finding missing objects with minimum time in a determined area. There are fundamentally two problems in these operations. The first problem is assessing highly reliable probability distribution maps, and the second is determining the search pattern that sweeps the area from the air as fast as possible. SAR operations benefit greatly from the GIS technology. The area, determined by the search planner, that is to be searched is called Search Area. This area may be sub-divided into search sub-areas for the purpose of assigning specific responsibilities to the available search facilities. The International Aeronautical and Maritime Search and Rescue Manual (IAMSAR) Vol. II (ICAO DOC 9731) provides all necessary information and guidance.

There is a need to develop a robust application to understand the groundwater scenario and groundwater resources of the regions. Representative groundwater level data needs to be analysed using statistical and arithmetical solutions along with the groundwater resources of the country to identify the blocks/district/state which has been critical compared to previous decade",https://youtu.be/gmACRfzMjkY,Data analytics to provide complete solution for groundwater management for the country,"Central Ground Water Board, Ministry of Jal Shakti",Software,DM84,Miscellaneous,https://www.sih.gov.in/uploads/logo/no_image.png
" Preoperative planning is a phase before actual surgery procedure in which the
surgeon can take all the time needed to define the surgical problem, to
identify fully all the anatomical and technical aspects of the procedure, and
then carefully plan the solution. In order to facilitate this, the patient is
assumed to be located in a coordinate system refered to as the ‘Patient
Coordinate System’(PCS), whereas the surgeon has access to pre-operative
medical scans(like CT/MRI etc.) of the subject in the coordinate system refered
to as the ‘Image Coordinate System’(ICS). Any procedure planned in medical
scans under ICS can be transfered to patient domain by utilizing this mapping.
The challenge of accurately establishing this mapping (or registration)
between PCS and ICS plays a critical role in influencing the reliability of the
surgery procedure itself. Currently accepted practice involves the use of
special markers called the ‘fiducials’ for the purpose of estimating PCS-to-ICS
mapping. Apart from estiablishing correspondances between the appearance
of fiducials in both patient and image coordinate systems, autonomas and
accurate localization of these markers in image coordinate system is an open-
challenge. Currently, surgeons manually annotate and localize these fiducials
or utilize semi-automatic tools provided by their treatment planning suite. The
goal of this challenge is therefore, to develop fully autonomas algorithm for
detection and localization of fiducials in pre-operative scans. Concretely, the
participants will be provided with MRI head-scans with fiducials affixed on the
skull surface and the task will be to estimate 3D coordinates of the center of
these fiducials with respect to the image coordinate system. Accruacy of their
algorithm will be tested on the corresponding ground-truth values and
generalization will be evaluated based on unseen test data.",,Fiducial localization for pre-operative planning in neurosurgery,Department of Atomic Energy,Software,PC86,Healthcare & Biomedical Devices,https://www.sih.gov.in/uploads/logo/20191014230506.png
" ""In case of man-made emergency situations which disrupt public life on greater scale e.g. war, tested solutions for rapid communications among large numbers of devices is required for relief efforts as well as monitoring of environment. A Mobile AdhocNETworking(MANET) protocol based on device geographical location information is conceptualized to serve as a gate way device. Problem is coding, simulation and testing of scalability. A network routing protocol is scalable in terms of number of nodes when it can accommodate additional nodes without increase of overhead for given limited area. The conceptualizedMANET protocolshall establish the source to destination path similar to zone routing protocols (ZRP). The path to destination is referred at source, in terms of the geological zones therefore allowing movement of intermediate mobile devices across path without disturbing the path. The devices get assigned new zone automatically using the GPS. The simulation scenario shall be source node is searching a path to friendly destination device, exchange data (hello) and drop the link. The devices follow random mobility pattern in 2 D frame. For searching of devices there is pre condition of knowing past history or pattern or set of fixed zones where destination node can reside. This is close to real world scenario where destinations reside at known zonessuch as home, office, commutation route, friend’s place, entertainment hub in area, railway station, airport etc. The MANET protocol, by nature of precondition, of knowing the possibility of location of devices; protects from spam connection and un authorized network broadcast. It is allowed ato modify the protocol to certain level to improve security, privacy without diluting the basic principal. The simulation is required to test the claim of scalability level in terms of N devices in simulation. A set of software codes will be required to be developed for simulation of the routing protocol.The simulation can be done using open source network simulator. It is required to test and simulate the concept of this routing protocol and its scalability. The metric of scalability will be success in search, establish and dropping the links between pairs of devices and amount of information shared when not having links. The largest possible MANET size is required to be order of 1000s. All MANET devices shall be interchangeable and there will not be any infrastructure dedicated node. All devise shall be replaceable without affecting MANET performance. Fixed location nodes can be used.
An example application can be MANET for police cars or disaster relief providers to enable connectivity in them without having to connect to any public network.""",,Network routing protocol for infrastructure less gateway devices in man-made,Department of Atomic Energy,Software,PC87,Smart Communication,https://www.sih.gov.in/uploads/logo/20191014230506.png

" The act of research sets the course for the development of any product or service. Without comprehensive research, all stages that follow in research activities could be greatly affected. Finding the required information for research can be difficult as the resources and information on internet and otherwise are often located in dispersed places, and accessing the right content can be time consuming. 

In this context, a single State research portal is needed to be designed in a manner that it can serve as a one-stop research portal for all the State Universities and colleges comprising the essential areas/parameters. Few of the areas to be incorporated are as given below:
a.	Navigating to information: It should be built on user experience best practices. As researchers are used to accessing websites (whether in their personal or professional lives) that respond to their screen size and are optimized for mobile, but also contain ideal user experience elements to make it easy to navigate (think single search bar front and center, clear organization of content etc.). 
b.	Uploading research, discovery of and access to information:  It should be a user-friendly research portal wherein the researchers can search and discover the right information and content for their work. They also be able to upload their research work university/college/miscellaneous wise which may further be categorized department/areas of study wise. 

A discovery service is the next tool to consider integrating into research portal. Consider how metadata is used, the methodology around searching and retrieving search results, how the tool anticipates users’ needs, and what can be integrated into the discovery tool. 

c.	Authentication: As research and collection of information resources become increasingly digital, authentication will be a key component to ensure the security of users and their content. For example, your collection may offer users access to various publisher or research platforms/portals that all have varying requirements for authentication.

One such solution may be through the use of embankment mapping and crowdsourced health card. Embankment mapping involves the development of GIS application to analyse the existing river embankment network. The crowd sourced data with images, geo-location and time stamp can be used for the generation of health card of embankment and identifying the critical sections thereof for their preventive maintenance.",https://youtu.be/0TGcTvdBzBA,Embankment Mapping and Crowdsourced Health Card for Preventive Structural Measures,"Central Water Commission, Ministry of Jal Shakti",Software,SK153,Miscellaneous,https://www.sih.gov.in/uploads/logo/no_image.png
" Lack of dynamic crop maps and opacity in water utilisation data prevents proper water accounting at the level of irrigation commands. Information regarding area under various crops is generally available at an aggregate level e.g. district wise cultivated area under individual crops. Non-availability ofactual crop maps preventsspatial visualisation of water utilisation and therefore proper water accounting. National Remote Sensing Centre (NRSC), Hyderabad generates yearly Land Use Land Cover (LULC) maps at a finer resolution of 56m containing land use classes of crop season and number of crops (single/multiple crop). Crowdsourced information from farmers, agricultural extension service providers, local administration and local population may be used for generation of crop type maps for a particular irrigation season which in turn may be used for preparation of water accounts at various spatial scales rangingfrom command of a major to minor irrigation project. Water Accounting at various spatial and temporal scales in commands of irrigation projects will help in informed decision making during the ensuing crop season and leads to optimal utilisation of irrigation water.

" Andhra Pradesh Pollution Control Board (APPCB) is a statutory organization entrusted to implement Environmental Laws and control pollution in the state of Andhra Pradesh through regulations.

APPCB is presently using cloud-based software to connect all the analyzers installed at the industries to obtain real time data. The data received is analyzed to monitor the exceedances against the prescribed standards for each industry. APPCB looks forward to bringing in all polluting industries in the state to enhance the existing system more transparent and effective monitoring of emissions and effluents.

As an extensively modernizing state, Andhra Pradesh is developing its industrial sector vigorously. Industries being significant source of both emission and effluents, are required to be monitored stringent monitoring. 

APPCB uses monitoring tools namely Continuous Emission Monitoring System (CEMS) and Continuous Effluent Quality Monitoring System (CEQMS) to check release of polluting emission and effluent to the environment. CEMS and CEQMS comprises analytical components and are continuous real time tools, providing monitoring data every minute.

Although there is a system of real time monitoring of polluting emissions and effluents from industries, APPCB is trying to develop a more efficient system that can provide authentic Continuous Emission Monitoring System (CEMS) and Continuous Effluent Quality Monitoring System (CEQMS). CEMS and CEQMS are calibrated in such a way that it collates data from different types of industries falling under different make and model as well as pollution category. Since each industrial sector under each pollution category may have set emission and effluent standards as prescribed by Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) or standardized by APPCB as per the local environmental conditions, ensuring reliability and consistency of the data received through CEMS and CEQMS are important.

Other areas of improvement for implementation of CEMS/CEQMS are as follows: Ensuring quality assurance of equipment and suitable technology, most reliable method of installation of analyzers, effectual reliable operation, ensuring credible data, viable data transfer calibration and maintenance of the equipment etc.

Additionally, enhancement of the existing online monitoring system is also required for development of an unswerving emission and effluent database for the state of Andhra Pradesh. Above mentioned are the need of the hour for Andhra Pradesh state as 13 town/cities in the state are already listed in the list of Non-Attainment cities w.r.t air pollution and five river stretches are categorized as polluted. It is crucial for APPCB as the key regulatory agency for pollution in the state.

"SAR satellites provide useful information for object detection. A methodology needs to be developed to detect ships at ocean area using SAR data and estimate size of the detected ships (size invariant). The methodology should be applicable for different resolution SAR data of same bands.

Develop software with following two features- 
a) Land water discrimination using SAR imagery,
b) Output detected ships as a vector file, with an estimate of the size of ship",,Size Invariant Ship detection from SAR Images,Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO),Software,NM404,Miscellaneous,https://www.sih.gov.in/uploads/logo/no_image.png
"These days almost every android smartphone includes a GNSS sensor. Increasingly this GNSS sensor supports hosts of GNSS constellation like GPS, Galileo, Beidou, Glonass and QZSS. In near future it will support NavIC also. Until now, the smartphone GNSS chipsets were operating on single frequency at L1 only. However, some of the advanced smartphone chipsets now supports L5 band also. Along with this a major development has happened wherein the android has enabled access to raw GNSS data also. This opens up enormous opportunity to develop newer smartphone based GNSS applications enabling accuracy and integrity, which was not possible earlier. This problem statement deals with the processing and visualization of such raw GNSS observable from the android devices. 
Desired Outcome: The teams are free to bring out novel processing strategies and their implementation on android, utilizing the raw GNSS observables. Detection of interference, interference localization, spoofing detection, enhancing accuracy, fusion with other smartphone sensors are the capabilities to name a few.",,"Processing, visualization and application development of raw GNSS data on Android Smartphones:",Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO),Software,NM405,Software - Mobile App development,https://www.sih.gov.in/uploads/logo/no_image.png
"The Global navigation Satellites transmit navigation signals for both civilian as well as strategic and military users. Concerning signals catering to civilian applications, all the necessary signal details are available and well documented. However, it is not available for the signals for strategic users. All the GNSS service provides be it, GPS, GLONASS, Galileo or Beidou is transmitting such signals for their strategic users. This problem deals with the subject of ethical hacking of strategic GNSS signals. Primarily the idea would be to process the recorded GNSS signals in order to extract the important signal feature such as, data rates, data frame lengths, correlation among data frames, spreading code structures, code lengths, overlay codes, spectral signatures etc.
Desired Outcome: Algorithms and processing software to extract the signal features from the recorded signals. As a test case GPS M-code signal can be considered.
DATA : Digitized signal records will be made available using ISRO facilities.",,Ethical hacking for extraction of restricted GNSS signal features,Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO),Software,NM406,Miscellaneous,https://www.sih.gov.in/uploads/logo/no_image.png
